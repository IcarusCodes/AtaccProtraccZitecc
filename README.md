# AtaccProtraccZitecc
#### *A TypeScript Protractor on Jasmine Automation Framework*

##Note to interviewers 

I will use this readme to also state some of my opinions on automation/code as well as trying to directly interact with  the interviewers, hello there!

Since the preferred language was either *JavaScript* or *PHP* I have decided to use the **former**
in conjunction with **Protractor**, however note that I *have not* used Protractor - or **any** FE/UI testing - for more
than 3 years(API team).

I have tried to structure this project following a **POM design** as well as I could, there might still be a lot of 
refactoring to be done and maybe not the best JS practices since I haven't used it in so long.


## Documentation
Documenting your code is **very** important, there is an unofficial belief that there should be one comment for *roughly* 
every 10 lines of code.    
 
 **I do abide by this** in some more complex projects/codebases, but I believe that when you read a page object 
you should be able to **understand** all the web elements of the page just from the **variable names** and when trying 
 to understand the functionalities of the page you should be able to do so **just by reading the method names**.

With that said I have provided some comments where I've felt it might have been needed, but *moreso* I've tried to name 
the variables in a verbose way.


##Setup

npm i

webdriver-manager update

webdriver-manager start &


## Running and reporting




Since I didn't have very much time to spend on this project(follow the commits) I have used some readily
available code for the reporting part. I've instead just fixed [this](https://praveendavidmathew.medium.com/creating-html-reports-for-protractor-7d9830ebf428) old broken code. 


##Test Cases:  
Positive




#### Final boomer note: I know that the company is called Zitech and not Zitecc, it is a play on words - just like Protecc was replaced by Protracc - a reference to Protractor. If unfamilliar with the meme or just confused about the project name, please see [this](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/he-protec-but-he-also-attac).
